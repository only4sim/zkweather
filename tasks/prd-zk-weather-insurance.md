# Product Requirements Document (PRD): ZK Weather Insurance Platform

## 1. Introduction / Overview

The ZK Weather Insurance Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables secure, privacy-preserving verification of weather radar data for agricultural insurance purposes. The platform leverages zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) to allow users to submit weather radar data, generate cryptographic proofs of rainfall assessments, and verify these proofs on the Zircuit blockchain network.

The system addresses the critical need for transparent, tamper-proof weather data verification in agricultural insurance, enabling farmers and insurers to settle claims based on verified meteorological evidence without revealing sensitive location or operational data.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Create a complete ZK-SNARK workflow for weather data verification on Zircuit network
- **Secondary Goal**: Provide an intuitive interface for developers and technical users to test ZK proof generation and verification
- **Tertiary Goal**: Demonstrate practical application of zkML for agricultural insurance use cases
- **Performance Goal**: Achieve proof generation and verification within acceptable time limits for practical use
- **Usability Goal**: Enable non-cryptography experts to interact with the ZK proof system through a user-friendly interface

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want to upload radar data features and generate ZK proofs so that I can test the zkML model verification process
- **As a technical user**, I want to submit pre-generated proofs to the smart contract so that I can verify the on-chain verification functionality
- **As an insurance assessor**, I want to verify weather data claims through blockchain proofs so that I can process insurance claims with cryptographic certainty
- **As a farmer**, I want to submit weather data for my location so that I can prove rainfall events for insurance purposes without revealing my exact location

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor proof generation and verification statistics so that I can ensure system reliability
- **As a researcher**, I want to analyze the performance metrics of ZK proof generation so that I can optimize the system

## 5. Hedera & AI Integration Plan

### Hedera Network Services
This project uses **Zircuit blockchain network** instead of Hedera, so this section is adapted for Zircuit:

- **Smart Contracts (EVM)**: Deploy the Verifier contract on Zircuit network for ZK proof verification
- **Network Configuration**: Configure Scaffold-ETH to connect to Zircuit RPC endpoints
- **Transaction Processing**: Handle proof verification transactions on Zircuit network

### AI / ML Components
- **zkML Model**: The core AI component is a rainfall assessment model trained on weather radar data
- **ZoKrates Framework**: Used for generating zero-knowledge proofs of ML model execution
- **Proof System**: Implements Groth16 zk-SNARKs for efficient proof generation and verification
- **Model Integration**: The ML model is compiled to ZoKrates circuit format for proof generation

### Bridges / Oracles (Optional)
- **Not applicable for initial implementation**
- **Future consideration**: Chainlink oracles for real-time weather data feeds

### SDK / Tooling
- **Primary SDK**: TypeScript/JavaScript with ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- **ZK Tooling**: ZoKrates CLI for proof generation and circuit compilation
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with React for user interface
- **Smart Contract Tools**: Hardhat for contract deployment and testing

## 6. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time Weather Data Integration**: The system will not automatically fetch live weather data from external APIs
2. **User Authentication/Authorization**: No user account management or access control beyond wallet connection
3. **Advanced Data Storage**: No persistent database or complex data warehousing
4. **Multi-chain Support**: Focus only on Zircuit network deployment
5. **Production-ready Insurance Logic**: No actual insurance policy management or claim processing
6. **Mobile App Development**: Web-based interface only, no native mobile applications
7. **Automated Proof Generation**: Users must manually trigger proof generation process

## 7. Design Considerations

### UI/UX Design
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, minimalist design with clear visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design approach with desktop optimization
- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue and green palette suggesting trust and nature

### Form Design
- **Organized Layout**: Group related radar features into logical sections
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **Data Visualization**: Charts or graphs showing input data patterns
